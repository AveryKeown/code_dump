 <h2>The "Nintendo Direct" Announcement</h2>
 <p>
    On June 21st, the latest Nintendo Direct revealed a new teaser trailer for the upcoming remake to the SNES classic, Super Mario RPG. It opened with a reimagined, fully 3D version of the iconic opening scene, and followed with a compilation of gameplay, including exploration, dialogue, and battling. Much of the world and characters are rendered quite faithfully to the original. The Mario cast even being given small, chibi-like models, replicating their older 2D sprites.

 <h3>What do these Changes Mean?</h3>

    While the remake is clearly rendered in 3D, not all that much seems to have been changed aesthetically. The colors seems just as vibrant, if not more so, than the original. This, and the more detailed 3D modelling allow the in-game areas to feel more immersive than before. Other than that, it's hard to tell what will be different in this new game. It seems to be going for a very faithful route, even going as far as to animate the characters with the grid-based movements as if they were sprites. It's likely that most of the gameplay and story events will remain same or slightly tweaked. For those who were worried about massive changes, this is good news. But to those hoping for bigger upgrades, this might be a bit of a letdown.
 </p>
 <p>
   To summarize the info, here are the biggest takeaways from the teaser:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The most notable difference are the 3D graphics
  </li>
  <li>
   Overall artstyle and animation is similar to the original
  </li>
  <li>
   Gameplay and story events seem largely unchanged
  </li>
  <li>
   The game appears to be aiming to be a faithful remake
  </li>
 </ul>
