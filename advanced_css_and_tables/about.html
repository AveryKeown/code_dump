            <h1>What's so Special about Wonder?</h1>
            <p>
                So new things are available in Wonder? Well there's a lot, but for simplicity's sake, I'll list the most important bits. First off, are the variety of new powerups! You've got a drill that allows you to go underground (or the ceiling) and attack enemies from high and low. There's also a Bubble flower that allows you harness the power of...bubbles. I swear it's stronger than it sounds. In fact they actually look pretty OP with their wide range when attacking enemies and your ability to use them as platforms to jump on. The last and likely the most famous/infamous powerfup: the Elephant Fruit! It literally turns you into a anthropomorphic elephant with the strength wack aside blocks and enemies in your path. You can also use it to spray water or push against strong opponents. In addition to those, there also seem to other returning powerups, like the classic Fire Flower and the Item Balloon. On top of those, there's a new set of items called Badges, but those will be discussed on the Gallery Page, as they're a lot to explain on their own and intersect in topic with the playable characters.

                There's also a load new enviroments, obstacles, and enemies added into this game as well. The premise of Wonder actually involves Mario and Co. travelling to the Flower Kingdom to save it from Bowser used the Wonder Flower to transform into a giant evil floating castle (yes, really). With the Flower Kingdom comes new faces such as Prince Florian and this other, weirder, talking flower who gives you hints and rewards for helping him. Meanwhile the levels of this new land do their best to live up to the name, Wonder. Traditional Mario landscapes have new floral twist that gives them a mystical look. There are inchworm pipes and floating dart blowers. You've also enemies capables of pushing and placing pipes around, watermelon piranna plants, dart birds, slime, stretchy goombas, shadow levels, space itself. You name it--they've got it! On top of that, the levels are open to be explored in almost any order you want! By-gone are the days of traditonal Mario level scalling, income a new mix-up of 2D Mario progression! To add even more intrigue into the mix, there's also online multiplayer now! You play alongside shadow players in real time, watching each other playing through levels and even assiting one another if they killed. Yoou can also collect heart points by engaging with other people in a variety of ways, like hitting standees or landing on the flagpole together.
