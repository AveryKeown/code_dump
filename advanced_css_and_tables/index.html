                So, on the last day of August, a new nintendo direct was streamed all about the upcoming 2D Super Mario Bros. installment: Super Mario Bros. Wonder. With that direct came all kinds of new info on the highly anticipated game. This site provides a compilation on all to be learned about Wonder for anyone who doesnâ€™t know what all the excitement is about. This inroduction page will give you basics on Mario Wonder and direct you to other pages. If you want to learn more about the gameplay or the characters, then I suggest you visit them.

                Super Mario Bros. was originally created as a 2D platformer and obtained worldwide fame through repeated successes with Super Mario Bros. 2, 3, and Super Mario World. Though Nintendo became quiet with their 2D Mario platformers for a while, 2006 saw a return to the classic era with new 3D graphics. The series was called NEW Super Mario Bros. It was meant to be rebooted version of 2D Mario games with some new elements added in. The first game on the DS recieved great critical and commercial success, prompting Nintendo to make more entries in this style (at least one per new console). But while that was going smoothly for a while, every subsequent game was less and less well recieved. While they were all fine games, their very repetive aesthetics, enemies, and powerups left people more bored and dissapointed than anything else. By the end of the Wii U era, people were tired of the NEW Super Mario Bros. series and wanted something different. It was clear that this style of Mario game had long outstayed its welcome. So after about 10 years following the last NEW-SMB game on the Wii U, Nintendo announced the new and innovative Super Mario Bros. Wonder. With it came a fresh change in artstyle, new powerups, enemies, locations, and a whole slew a new whimsical, very Nintendo-y features that quickly made the game very hyped up among Nintendo fans.
