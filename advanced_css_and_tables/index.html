                I feel like this was made by someone not from this country--on another planet, and they found out that there was money to be made in this market...and they took the essense of the other Neighbor games--like the copies of the copies of the Neighbor games--and then they just distill that and then they turn it into their own unique element, so now we have "Bloody Napkin" and "Strange Dog House". It's all the same stuff.
