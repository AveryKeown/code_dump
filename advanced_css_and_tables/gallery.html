                Super Mario Bros. Wonder features a whopping 12 characters to play, making the character selection the largest out of any 2D Mario platformer. Most of them are returning favorites, like Luigi, Peach, the Toads. Additionally, we've got Toadette making her first playable debut, alongside the return of Nabbit. But we also (finally) have Princess Daisy making her first debut as a playable character for a main series Mario game! Despite being around for decades, and appearing in many of Mario's spinoff titles, Daisy had never actually made it to playable status in one of the platformers (even Rosalina beat her to the punch). So it's quite refreshing and exiting to her join the crew of heroes in saving the Mushroom Kingdom for once. That's not all, Yoshi (four Yoshis actually) are also now playable. They, along with Nabbit, actually have a different, somewhat easier style of play tailored to younger and/or less gaming experienced people who want a breezier experience with the game. Unlike everyone else, these five don't take damage (but can still die from other hazards), can't change forms with power ups, an instead have unique, permanent abilites the other guys don't. Everyone else, from Mario to Toadette, all have the same playstyles this time around. This is notably different form other Mario platformers, where each of the selectable characters had a unique quirk that changed how you played through levels.

                    So if they've taken away the character quirks, does mean there'll be no other playstyles besides the Yoshis and Nabbit? As it turns out, no! Replacing the character quirks from previous entries are Badges. Each badge grants the player a buff, like speed or jump, allowing them to play better as they progress through the game. But your can only have one badge at a time, so only one effect at a time. This effectively recreates the original quirk gimick of older titles, except now you can put those effects on any character you want. So you can be a Mario that floats like Peach, or a Daisy whos as fast as a Toad. This way you play as anyone you feel like without having to sacrifice a perferred playstyle.
