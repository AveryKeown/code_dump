                <h3>History and Developement</h3>
                <P>
                    Rimworld is an indie game developed by Ludeon Studios (with Tynan Sylvester as the lead designer). It was a survival and management game taking inspiration from older titles like Dwarf Fortress and Firefly. In 2013, it was released in early access under the name "Eclipse Colony" with a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. 5 years later, in 2018, it was fully released on Windows, Mac, and Lunix systems. It garnered large positive reception and an active fan following. In fact, the game has a very active modding community, even now, and various high quality mods are available. Since then, the game has recieved several updates and three additional DLC packs. In 2022, there was even a console port of the game to the Xbox One and Playstation 4.

                    This part easily gets it's own section because of just how important your colonists (aka: pawns) are to your ability to survive and thrive. You'll notice (if your playing the "crashlanded" story) that the left side of your screen has a 3 pawns at the top and a list of others that are "left behind". The top 3 are the ones you begin the game with. Move them around to change the team. Clicking on an idividual pawn shows The colonist menu can seem a little overwhelming at first but it's not hard to break it down into sections: the name/nickname, appearance, traits(most important), bodily health(2nd most important), and relationships.
