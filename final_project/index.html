                <h2>What is Rimworld?</h2>
                <h3>History and Developement</h3>
                <P>
                    Rimworld is an indie game developed by Ludeon Studios (with Tynan Sylvester as the lead designer). It was a survival and management game taking inspiration from older titles like Dwarf Fortress and Firefly. In 2013, it was released in early access under the name "Eclipse Colony" with a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. 5 years later, in 2018, it was fully released on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It garnered large positive reception and an active fan following. In fact, the game has a very active modding community, even now, and various high quality mods are available. Since then, the game has received several updates and three additional DLC packs. In 2022, there was even a console port of the game to the Xbox One and Playstation 4.

                <h3>Premise</h3>
                <p>
                    The core appeal of Rimworld is that it allows you create and get invested in your own story of colonists. While the game falls into the genre of survival-management, it is self-described as a "story-generator". This is because progression through the game is heavily affected by randomly generated events and setups. These events, dictated by one of 3 AI-storytellers, are intertwined with the play's progress and create many kinds of instense, funny, or tragic moments. One moment, the player becomes able to tame the rarest animals due to a colonist's inspiration, and they next: they lose half of their colony to an army of manhunter squirrels. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The actual premise of playing through Rimworld is a Sci-fi narrative set in the very distant future. A group of space travellers crashland on a planet at the edge of civilization, called a "rimworld", and they have to build a colony and survive long enough to build a rocketship and escape to the stars. The main gameplay involves the player managing a colony of "pawns": building structures, growing food, reasearching and advancing their technology, and defending their base from raids and other threats. Importantly, they also have to manage their pawns, who each have their own unique traits, relationships, and health. The pawns are the people trying to escape the rimworld and who need to remain in good physical and mental condition in order to carry out their tasks. They are also the main characters of the story you're about to craft.

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <h3>Starting a New Game</h3>
                <img src="images/narrator.png" alt="Cassandra Classic on the Storyteller Menu with difficulty options">
                <p>
                    At the home menu, you'll have the option to either start a new game or play the tutorial (starting a new game but with guidance). If this is your first time playing, you should probably play the tutorial first. But you can also just do a normal game follow this guide. The first thing to pop up when you start a new game will be the scenario select. A scenario decides what/how many colonists and items you start out with, as well as how much technology you have researched at the start. The "Crashlanded" scenario is most default out of the 4, and is the best choice for a first-timer. (I'll be assuming you chose this one for the rest of this guide.) Next, are the 3 AI Storytellers: Cassandra Classic, Phoebe Chillax, and Randy Random. Their names are pretty self-explainatory and you can read about their characteristics by clicking on them. Despite their differences, all three can be equally hard (unfair even) in their own ways. However, Cassandra and Phoebe on Peaceful or Builder mode are the best suited for beginners. Peaceful difficulty plays like Animal Crossing but with hunger stats. Builder and Adventure are more suited for first-timers or people who don't want a hardcore playthrough. Strive to Survive & Blood and Dust are the challenge modes, and Losing is Fun is exactly what it says on the tin. Committment and Reload Anytime are also self-explainatory, it just depends on how hardcore you want your game to be.
                </p>
                <h3>Colonist Selecting</h3>
                <img src="images/pawncreator.png" alt="Colonist Selection Menu">
                <p>
                    This part easily gets it's own section because of just how important your colonists/pawns are to your ability to survive and thrive. You'll notice that the left side of your screen has a 3 pawns at the top and a list of others that are "left behind". The top 3 are the ones you begin the game with. Move them around to change the team. Clicking on an idividual pawn shows The colonist menu can seem a little overwhelming at first but it's not hard to break it down into sections: the name/nickname, appearance, traits, skills, health, and relationships. Unless your're playing with mods, the only thing you can change about a pawn is the Name and Nickname. You may see that your pawn has some pre-established relationships, but theose aren't too important unless one of the listed people shows up in your playthrough. Health and Age are things you should consider when choosing a colonist. Injurys can affect how well your colonists perform and cause them pain. They can also have addictions that harm their mental health. The older a pawn is biologically, the more likely they are to develope age-related diseases like dementia. Colonists under 18 will lack a second "adulthood" origin story (that isn't necessarily good or bad).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Skills and traits are two most important parts of a pawn. Skills are the stats pawns have (measured in levels) that can be developed over time. Some pawns will have small or large passions for skills (indicated by flames beside the stat) which allow them to grow faster in that skill. Pawns have extra levels in their skills from RNG and their backstory(ies). Some backstories will disable a pawn from using certain skills/doing certain tasks (indicated by a non-existent bar beside a skill). Traits are basically your colonist's personality quirks. Pawns will have 1-3 of these. Traits can be good, bad, both, or neutral. They might make your pawn prettier and better at socializing, or a fast skill learner, or resistent to damage. They may also make them uglier, violent, or a pyromaniac that loves to start fires.

                    <div class="tip">
                        <p>Tip: Pyromaniac is commonly said to be the worst trait because of how much damage fire can do to a base in short time. Players often avoid using these pawns entirely, regardless of their other abilities.</p>

                <p>
                    When you're done creating your colony, the next menu will allow to customize how your world generates. The factions on the right don't need to be customized for a person's first time through, so you can leave them alone for now. Customizing the temperature, precipitaion, and population is also ill-advised as changing them too much can create world you may not survive. Changing the seed though is just fine for a beginner, so go ahead. The world map screen divides the planet into many mini-sectors. Choosing one will be your landing spot, and thus, where you build your base. I recommend looking for the Temperate Forest biome, which is a light green area. Try to pick one outside of mountainous areas, which have rocks on their sectors. There are many other biomes too, but this forest is the most beginner friendly. You'll see why by clicking on a sector and then clicking "Terrain". There you'll find a summary of what the biome is like, plus a bunch of other data. Then hit "Next" to start your game!

                    <p>
                        When you truly start the game, you'll be greeted with a lotta buttons to press and objects to click. But don't fear; unlike Dwarf Fortress, Rimworld's UI is actually designed to be comprehensible to human beings! I promise it's not too hard to figure out. If your playing the tutorial, it will help direct you to doing all the important stuff. On the bottom of your screen, you'll see a line of buttons. Click on Architect to see all options related to building and zones. By clicking on each one, you'll see what kinds of walls, orders, benches, zones, etc you're able to make. If you click a buildable structure/object, you can click or drag your mouse along the ground to choose where it will be placed. For "Orders" and "Zones", drag/click on objects/areas to designated were things will be done or placed. After you do so, your pawns will follow your commands. The first thing you should do is click on the "Allow" command from "Orders" and highlight all steel, wood, medicine, food, weapons, etc so your pawns can access them.

                    <p>
                        If you click on an individual colonist, you'll see a menu displaying everything you need to know about them. You can read their log to see what they've been up to, check their mood and health, and other things. If you select a pawn and then right-click an object or bench, you can tell to prioritize doing a task with it. The pawn will stop anything they're doing currently and work on that task until it's finished. This  is useful if your in a hurry, like hauling a deteriorating item or someone that's bleeding-out. If a fire starts, prioritze pawns to put it out. When a pawn is selected, you can also draft them for combat. After doing so, right-click whatever spot you want them to go to, and they'll move there and remain (until you move them again). You can also right-click enemies to make pawns target them. Right-click a downed opponent to arrest them, or a downed ally to rescue them. You can also draft all pawns at once by dragging over them and selecting the button. Remember to undraft your pawns after combat, otherwise they'll never move!

                    <h2>Early Game Priorities</h2>
                    <h3>Setting up a Colony</h3>
                    <p>
                        If you read the UI section, you should know how to place walls by now, so go do it. You can also order your pawns to mine into hills of rock if you don't want to spend all your wood in one place. Ultilize the zone tool to build at least one stockpile zone indoors to protect perishables from the outdoors. If you put down multiple, you can select a zone to edit it's priority an what items can be stored inside. You should also place down a growing zone (I recommend selecting it and changing the crop to rice, as it grows the fastest). If you chack the "wildlife" tab at the bottom of the screen, you can select animals to hunt for food. Go into your production tab and construct a wood-fueled stove, a research bench, and butchering spot/table. These allow you to cook meals, research technology, and butcher animals for meat/fabric respectively. Put down some sleeping spots or beds indoors for your colonists to sleep. You can assign beds to specific people. Order your colonists to chop down several trees--your gonna need a lot of wood. Build torches to provide light for your colonists (they don't like the dark). After your research bench is complete, go to the research tab and select a project to study. (I HIGHLY recommend "Electricity" because you're gonna need it for A LOT of things, including preserving food, which is essential.) Next, make your colonists pick up dropped weaponry if they haven't already done so. Make sure your best shooters have the shotguns and your best melee guys have the knives. Place some barrades in the area around your base. It will act as cover for you pawns during a raid. Finally, craft a horseshoe ring somewhere outside, so your colonists can fulfill their recreation with it.

                    <div class="tips">
                        <div class="tip">
                            <p>Tip: Don't build too wide of a space in cave without also building a pillar. Otherwise, the roof may collapse and instantly kill colonists beneath it. (There may also be hidden danger if you dig too far in and wide.)</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tip">
                            <p>Tip: Avoid hunting and taming animals with a percentage chance to retaliate. Some will only retaliate when hunted, or only when trying to tame. Send 2 people at a time if you want to tame or hunt a violatile animal.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="tip">
                            <p>Tip: You can't cook with meat unless you butcher it first. Also, try keeping your stove in a clean area, or at least away from dirty/bloody places like the butcher spot. It reduces the risk of food poisoning.</p>

                    <h3>Supplies, Research, and Power</h3>
                    <img src="images/electricity.png">
                    <p>
                        Other things you should have for production, are tailor benches, stonecutters, and crafting spots. They have their own uses that you'll see when you look at their Bills. Bills, by the way, are what you select when you click on a bench/spot to produce items. You can decide how many items are produced and what material they're made of. Power is one of the most important things to advance in Rimworld. You already have wood and bio-fueled generators and conduets (which connect devices to the power source). But Wind-mills, water-mills, solar-power, and especially geothermal power all better things to build for more electricity generation. They don't cost wood or biofuel, but solar-power and windmills can be disrupted by weather events or blockage. If you put conduets under wooden walls, you should change them to stone or steel walls, because electrical components love to explode sometimes and you don't want your walls catching on fire. On that note, you should also keep colonist beds away from those walls so they won't be caught in the explosion. Also, when one research project is complete, start the next one immediately. There's no reason to not have one going at all times. When you have the basics all set-up you can focus on building out your base more and creating new storage spaces, like refrigerator rooms or raw material rooms. To create a refrigerator room, you'll have to research and then build a cooler. Build a medium sized room, and replace a block of its wall with the cooler (with the cool/blue side facing inisde the room, and the hot/red side facing outside). After it's connect to the conduet, select it and turn down the target temperature until it's freezing. There! You now have a working refrigerator to preserve food, animal bodies, and medicine throughout the year.

                    <h3>Colonist Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Finally, we reach the main the characters of your story, the colonists! Whenever you assign orders, construction, or bills, your colonists will gradually do them in accordance to priority and schedule. Looking at the bottom row of tabs again, you'll see a Work and a Schedule tab. If you select the Work tab, you'll see a menu of all the task categories that your colonists are set to perform. It defaults to non-manuel mode, and every task that can be assigned has been assigned to everyone. It's best to turn that off, and instead assign task to pawns with specific priority. Checking a box at 1 puts it at the highest priority, and 4 is the lowest. Unchecking the box means your pawn won't do a task at all.
