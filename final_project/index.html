                <h3>History and Developement</h3>
                <P>
                    Rimworld is an indie game developed by Ludeon Studios (with Tynan Sylvester as the lead designer). It was a survival and management game taking inspiration from older titles like Dwarf Fortress and Firefly. In 2013, it was released in early access under the name "Eclipse Colony" with a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. 5 years later, in 2018, it was fully released on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It garnered large positive reception and an active fan following. In fact, the game has a very active modding community, even now, and various high quality mods are available. Since then, the game has recieved several updates and three additional DLC packs. In 2022, there was even a console port of the game to the Xbox One and Playstation 4.

                <h3>Premise</h3>
                <p>
                    The core appeal of Rimworld is that it allows you create and get invested in your own story of colonists. While the game falls into the genre of survival-management, it is self-described as a "story-generator". This is because progression through the game is heavily affected by randomly generated events and setups. These events, dictated by one of 3 AI-storytellers, are intwined with the play's progress and result in unpredicted shifts, good and bad, in their playthrough that create many kinds of instense, funny, or tragic moments. One moment, the player suddenly becomes able to tame the rarest animals due to a colonist's inspiration, and they next they lose half of their colony form an army of vengeful squirrels.

                    The actual premise of playing through this game is a Sci-fi narrative set in the very distant future. A group of space travellers crashland on a planet at the edge of civilization, called a "Rimworld", and they have to build a colony and survive long enough to build a rocketship to escape to the stars. The main gameplay involves the player managing a colony of "pawns": building structures, growing food, reasearching and advancing their technology, and defending their base from raids and other threats. Importantly, they also have to manage their pawns, who each have their own unique traits, relationships, and health. The pawns are the people trying to escape the rimworld and who need to remain in good physical and mental condition in order to carry out their tasks. They are also the main characters of the story you are about to craft

                    This part easily gets it's own section because of just how important your colonists (aka: pawns) are to your ability to survive and thrive. You'll notice (if your playing the "crashlanded" story) that the left side of your screen has a 3 pawns at the top and a list of others that are "left behind". The top 3 are the ones you begin the game with. Move them around to change the team. Clicking on an idividual pawn shows The colonist menu can seem a little overwhelming at first but it's not hard to break it down into sections: the name/nickname, appearance, traits(most important), bodily health(2nd most important), and relationships.
