                <P>
                    Rimworld is an indie game developed by Ludeon Studios (with Tynan Sylvester as the lead designer). It was a survival and management game taking inspiration from older titles like Dwarf Fortress and Firefly. In 2013, it was released in early access under the name "Eclipse Colony" with a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. 5 years later, in 2018, it was fully released on Windows, Mac, and Lunix systems. It garnered large positive reception and an active fan following. In fact, the game has a very active modding community, even now, and various high quality mods are available. Since then, the game has recieved several updates and three additional DLC packs. In 2022, there was even a console port of the game to the Xbox One and Playstation 4.
