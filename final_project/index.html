                <h2>What is Rimworld?</h2>
                <h3>History and Developement</h3>
                <P>
                    Rimworld is an indie game developed by Ludeon Studios (with Tynan Sylvester as the lead designer). It was a survival and management game taking inspiration from older titles like Dwarf Fortress and Firefly. In 2013, it was released in early access under the name "Eclipse Colony" with a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter. 5 years later, in 2018, it was fully released on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It garnered large positive reception and an active fan following. In fact, the game has a very active modding community, even now, and various high quality mods are available. Since then, the game has recieved several updates and three additional DLC packs. In 2022, there was even a console port of the game to the Xbox One and Playstation 4.

                <h3>Premise</h3>
                <p>
                    The core appeal of Rimworld is that it allows you create and get invested in your own story of colonists. While the game falls into the genre of survival-management, it is self-described as a "story-generator". This is because progression through the game is heavily affected by randomly generated events and setups. These events, dictated by one of 3 AI-storytellers, are intwined with the play's progress and result in unpredicted shifts, good and bad, in their playthrough that create many kinds of instense, funny, or tragic moments. One moment, the player suddenly becomes able to tame the rarest animals due to a colonist's inspiration, and they next they lose half of their colony form an army of vengeful squirrels.

                <p>
                    The actual premise of playing through this game is a Sci-fi narrative set in the very distant future. A group of space travellers crashland on a planet at the edge of civilization, called a "Rimworld", and they have to build a colony and survive long enough to build a rocketship to escape to the stars. The main gameplay involves the player managing a colony of "pawns": building structures, growing food, reasearching and advancing their technology, and defending their base from raids and other threats. Importantly, they also have to manage their pawns, who each have their own unique traits, relationships, and health. The pawns are the people trying to escape the rimworld and who need to remain in good physical and mental condition in order to carry out their tasks. They are also the main characters of the story you are about to craft

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <h3>Starting a New Game</h3>

                <h3>Colonist Selecting</h3>
                <img src="images/pawncreator.png" alt="Colonist Selection Menu">
                <p>
                    This part easily gets it's own section because of just how important your colonists/pawns are to your ability to survive and thrive. You'll notice that the left side of your screen has a 3 pawns at the top and a list of others that are "left behind". The top 3 are the ones you begin the game with. Move them around to change the team. Clicking on an idividual pawn shows The colonist menu can seem a little overwhelming at first but it's not hard to break it down into sections: the name/nickname, appearance, traits, skills, health, and relationships. Unless your're playing with mods, the only thing you can change about a pawn is the Name and Nickname. You may see that your pawn has some pre-established relationships, but theose aren't too important unless one of the listed people shows up in your playthrough. Health and Age are things you should consider when choosing a colonist. Injurys can affect how well your colonists perform and cause them pain. They can also have addictions that harm their mental health. The older a pawn is biologically, the more likely they are to develope age-related diseases like dementia. Colonists under 18 will lack a second "adulthood" origin story (that isn't necessarily good or bad).

                    Skills and traits are two most important parts of a pawn. Skills are the stats pawns have (measured in levels) that can be developed over time. Some pawns will have small or large passions for skills (indicated by flames beside the stat) which allow them to grow faster in that skill. Pawns have extra levels in their skills from RNG and their backstory(ies). Some backstories will disable a pawn using certain skills/doing certain tasks (indicated by a non-existent bar beside a skill). Traits are basically your colonist's personality quirks. Pawns will have 1-3 of these. Traits can be good, bad, both, or neutral. They might make your pawn prettier and better at socializing, or a fast skill learner, or resistent to damage. They may also make them uglier, violent, or a pyromaniac that loves to start fires.

                    <div class="tip">
                        <p>Tip: Pyromaniac is commonly said to be the worst trait because of how much damage fire can do to a base in short time. Players often avoid using these pawns entirely, regardless of their other abilities.</p>

                    When you're done creating your colony, the next menu will allow to customize how your world generates. The factions on the right don't need to be customized for a person's first time through, so you can leave them alone for now. Customizing the temperature, precipitaion, and population is also ill-advised as changing them too much can create world you may not survive. Changing the seed though is just fine for a beginner, so go ahead. The world map screen divides the planet into many mini-sectors. Choosing one will be your landing spot, and thus, where you build your base. I recommend looking for the Temperate Forest biome, which is a light green area. Try to pick one outside of mountainous areas, which have rocks on their sectors. There are many other biomes too, but this forest is the most beginner friendly. You'll see why by clicking on a sector and then clicking "Terrain". There you'll find a summary of what the biome is like, plus a bunch of other data. Then hit "Next" to start your game!
